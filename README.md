# Logistic-Regression
Suppose you are the product manager of the factory and you have the test results for some microchips on two different tests i.e 𝑥1 and 𝑥2. From these two tests, you would like to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected. To help you make the decision, you have a dataset of test results on past microchips, from which you can build a logistic regression model. The scatter plot of training data is as shown below. Note features have been normalized.
