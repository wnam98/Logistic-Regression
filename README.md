# Binary Classification of a Microchip Dataset using Logistic Regression
Suppose you are the product manager of the factory and you have the test results for some microchips on two different tests i.e ùë•1 and ùë•2. From these two tests, you would like to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected. To help you make the decision, you have a dataset of test results on past microchips, from which you can build a logistic regression model. The scatter plot of training data is as shown below. Note features have been normalized.

Logisitic Regression is used to model the probability of a feature belonging to a certain class (in this case, pass/fail). Each object would be assigned a probability between 0 and 1 and a discriminant function would group the features to the appropriate classes. The basic model is displayed below:
